### Hi there, I'm Mitch. 👋

I am currently a Software Engineer working for a company called <a href="https://buildkite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buildkite</a>🪁. I would take whatever you see in these public GitHub repos with a grain of salt...they are mostly side projects and built with questionable practices and commit hygiene! 😅
